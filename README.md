# LSM303DLHC Python Driver

This repository contains a Python driver for the LSM303DLHC, a 3D accelerometer and 3D magnetometer module. The driver operates in user space, providing an easy-to-use interface for interacting with the LSM303DLHC sensor.

## Features

- Read accelerometer and magnetometer data
- Configure sensor settings
- Simple and intuitive API

## Installation

To install the driver, clone this repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/lsm303dlhc-py.git
cd lsm303dlhc-py
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Here's a basic example of how to use the driver:

```python
from lsm303dlhc import LSM303DLHC

sensor = LSM303DLHC()

# Read accelerometer data
accel_data = sensor.read_accelerometer()
print("Accelerometer:", accel_data)

# Read magnetometer data
mag_data = sensor.read_magnetometer()
print("Magnetometer:", mag_data)
```
